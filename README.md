# GoweDAO - Contract Performance Reputation Oracle (Soonami Venturethon MVP)

GoweDAO aims to build a trustless contract performance reputation system on a private Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This system records and analyzes contract outcomes to generate reliable reputation scores, fostering greater trust and efficiency in B2B transactions.

This repository contains the frontend simulation MVP developed for the Soonami Venturethon Cohort 7.

## Project Vision

To establish a new standard of trust in B2B commerce through a decentralized, verifiable contract performance reputation system.

## Problem Solved

Traditional B2B transactions lack objective metrics for counterparty reliability, leading to costly due diligence, delays, and missed opportunities. Existing credit scores or reviews are often fragmented and subjective. GoweDAO addresses this by providing data-driven, on-chain verified reputation.

## MVP Overview

This MVP is a **frontend simulation** designed to demonstrate the core user flow and concept of GoweDAO. It allows users to:

1.  Select a contract template.
2.  Simulate deploying the contract and submitting it for DAO approval.
3.  Visualize the simulated DAO approval process.
4.  View a simulated tokenomics/staking dashboard with basic interactions.

**Note:** This MVP does **not** currently interact with a live blockchain or smart contracts. All operations are simulated in the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Run This MVP

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3.  Open `index.html` directly in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## Technology Stack (MVP Simulation)

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Future Vision

Our roadmap includes:
* Developing and deploying the private PoS blockchain and core smart contracts (based on research proposing an Avalanche Subnet, modular blockchain, and object-oriented smart contracts).
* Implementing a robust, potentially AI-enhanced reputation scoring algorithm.
* Building out the full DAO governance structure.
* Integrating advanced AI features for risk prediction, dispute analysis, and reputation manipulation detection.
* Launching a pilot program with B2B enterprises.

## Based on Research

This project is based on the foundational concepts outlined in the research paper:
"Development of a Contract Management System Using Blockchain" by Hiroshi Fujimoto et al. (IPSJ SIG Technical Report, Vol.2025-DPS-202 No.16 / Vol.2025-CSEC-108 No.16).
